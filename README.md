# Ruby Bindings for OpenCV 
ROpenCV are ffi ruby bindings for the Open Source Computer Vision Library
[OpenCV](http://opencv.org/opencv-java-api.html).

Unlike other OpenCV ruby binding projects like
[ruby-opencv](https://github.com/ruby-opencv/ruby-opencv/) or
[opencv-ffi](https://github.com/amarburg/opencv-ffi) these bindings are
automatically generated by parsing the OpenCV C++ headers having the following
advantages:

  * automatically up-to-date
  * full API coverage
  * closely match the original C++ interface

## State:
- All marked methods in the OpenCV C++ header are wrapped
- Memory management needs review
- Currently, no support for multi threading or GPU

## License
ROpenCV is released under a BSD license, it is free for both academic and
commercial use.

## Compatibility Notes
ROpenCV should run on any platform which supports Ruby and OpenCV 2.4.4 or
higher. It has been successfully tested on the following platforms.

  * Linux with Ruby 1.9.3 and OpenCV 2.4.4 - 2.4.6
  * Mac OSX with Ruby 1.9.3 and OpenCV 2.4.4 - 2.4.6

## Installation
After running the following commands, ROpenCV and all the mandatory
dependencies should be installed:

### Ubuntu / Debian
  * [Install OpenCV 2.4.4 or newer.](http://opencv.org/downloads.html)
  * sudo apt-get install ruby rubygems cmake g++
  * sudo gem install ropencv

### Usage

    require 'ropencv'
    include OpenCV
    m = cv::Mat.new(3,3,cv::CV_64FC1)

# Example

    require 'ropencv'
    include OpenCV

    mat = cv::imread("logo.png")
    detector = cv::FeatureDetector::create("SURF")
    keypoints = Std::Vector.new(cv::KeyPoint)
    detector.detect(mat,keypoints)

    puts "found #{keypoints.size} keypoints"
    puts "first keypoint is at #{keypoints[0].pt.x}/#{keypoints[0].pt.y}"

    cv::draw_keypoints(mat,keypoints,mat)
    cv::imshow("key_points",mat)
    cv::wait_key(-1)
